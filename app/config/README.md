# 📁 **Config Folder Overview**

The `config` folder contains the core configuration components for the **LLMOps Medical Chatbot** project.
Its purpose is to centralise environment loading, API keys, and all global settings required across the chatbot pipelines and services.

## Files

### **config.py**

Provides the main configuration module for the project.
It loads required environment variables, exposes API keys, and defines key paths and settings such as model identifiers, vector store locations, and text chunking parameters used throughout the Medical Chatbot system.

If you want, I can also generate a `__init__.py` description here or expand this README with usage examples (e.g., `from config.config import HF_TOKEN`).
